# Emil's BBS Filmstudio

Emil's BBS Filmstudio is a modpack made by me, Emil_the_sleeper, it is built around BBS Mod by McHorse.

The Pack includes basic mods which make minecraft look a little better and make it run a little faster.

I also put some extra gimmicks like [Freelook](https://modrinth.com/mod/freelook), [Controlling](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlling), [Custom LAN](https://modrinth.com/mod/custom-lan), [Not Enough Crashes](https://modrinth.com/mod/notenoughcrashes), [Screenshot to Clipboard](https://modrinth.com/mod/screenshot-to-clipboard), [Wavey Capes](https://modrinth.com/mod/wavey-capes), [Xaero's World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) in the pack, to make the game feel more convenient compared to a normal preset.

If you don't know what BBS(Blockbuster Studio) by McHorse is, it is a newer version of his 8-year old Blockbuster Mod, these mods allow you to create films in Minecraft, similar to ReplayMod or Flashback, with the difference, that you can import models from Blockbench, and you have to record all actions yourself. A very important perk is, that you can adjust every single motion the way you want, this allows you to basically create anything you want within minecraft.

MC Version: 1.20.4
